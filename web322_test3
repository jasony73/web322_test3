// question 1
Write all the scripts needed for server.js and the search.hbs to answer the following requests:

- Your search.hbs should have the following:

You are required to build a simple Advanced Search form consist of the following:
all these words: (TextBox)
none of these words: (TextBox)
Submit (Button)
When the user submits the form data to the server, the form should not clear the entered values.

The output results should be rendered below the form if the form data pass the validation successfully.

Your form also should not clear the data if there is a validation error.

All error messages must be rendered in their respective areas (before each form element).

- Your server.js should do the following:

You have to check all the form fields are not nulls (not empty).
You have to create an error object contain all the error messages for the all form elements. 


REMINDER:  All back-end functionality MUST be done using Node JS and Express. Your views MUST be created with Express-Handlebars.

question 2
Assume you have the following "customers" object, and you want to show the fields information (id,company, firstname,lastname) in the "customers.hbs" template view as a TABLE.

When the user clicks on the "id" value of any of these rows, more information is shown at the top of the page as a TABLE. You must use a partial template "customers_info.hbs" to show the details about the customer.

NOTE: When a customer clicks, both tables should appear on the same page.

Please write all the necessary scripts to render the object in the template "customers.hbs" by the "server.js" file when you receive the customer id as a parameter in the URL, ex. "/customer/4FG12Y7U6".



[

{ "id": "4FG12Y7U6", "company": "Avionics Inc.", "firstname": "John", "lastname": "Doe", "entered": "2013-06-12T10:00:00Z" },

{ "id": "4FG12Y7TX", "company": "Avis World Headquarters", "firstname": "Steve", "lastname": "Herbin", "entered": "2013-09-10T10:00:00Z" },

{ "id": "4FG12Y7TV", "company": "BGP Productions", "firstname": "German", "lastname": "Vicencio", "entered": "2013-09-30T12:46:40Z" }

... additional data omitted

]

Note: 

You have to make sure that the object contains values; else, you must show a message saying "no information available."
